When you run the program? first you'll see is a map. To generate another map you'll need to press any button. Pressing F(only English registry) button will lead you to 3d scene. 

First you appear in spectator mode, where you can fly over the map (WASD,SPACE,SHIFT controls).

To change mode to player perspective(or back), press F. Try to reach the end of a map. If you fail, press F to enter spectator mode or close the app by ESC button.
